The array a is passed to the function f as a pointer. The function f then goes into this pointer's data storage location and modifies the data there, so when we look at the end result the array is modified with every term having 2 added to it.

The term y is passed via value, so a copy of b is created in f. b's value in main() is unaffected.

Therefore the output is:

2
4
6
8
10
16
